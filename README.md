# Scheme exercises from the wizard book.
This repo contains my solutions for the exercises presented in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).

To run exercises install the [MIT Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) and run the following:
```bash
scheme < <scheme_file>
```
